As team members co-construct solutions, tacit knowledge (e.g., intuition, problem-solving styles) emerges organically through shared experiences. Trust and collaboration enhance learning quality by promoting peer feedback and mentoring, where experienced individuals guide novices in refining both explicit techniques and implicit judgment. Over time, this builds robust, context-sensitive tacit structures that improve team adaptability and collective expertise.",
