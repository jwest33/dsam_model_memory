When a PL/pgSQL procedure, function, or block encounters an error (such as a division by zero, a foreign key violation, or an invalid data type), the system automatically raises an exception. By default, this could cause the entire block to terminate abruptly—potentially leading to data inconsistency or unhandled crashes.\n\nTo prevent this, developers use exception handling to **intercept and respond to runtime errors**.

While the final deliverable—a well-structured, accurate study plan—met the required standards, intermediate steps in the process generated outputs that exceeded the intended length or scope. This suggests that the model generated detailed, context-rich responses during reasoning phases, which, although not strictly constrained, ultimately contributed to the correctness and clarity of the final product. The additional content in intermediate stages may have reflected the model’s natural tendency to explore multiple angles or provide explanatory elaborations, enhancing depth of thought but requiring post-processing to ensure alignment with minimal output specifications. Nonetheless, the final result was both valid and fully compliant with the prompt’s objectives.",
